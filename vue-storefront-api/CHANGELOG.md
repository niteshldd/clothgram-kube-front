## [1.11.0-rc.1] - 2019.10.03

### Added
- Experimental Elastic 7 support - @pkarw (#342)
- Output cache support with tagging and cache invalidate requests forwarding - @pkarw @resubaka (https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/issues/3367, #333)
- Constant for Mailchimp subscription status - @KonstantinSoelch (#294)
- mage2vs import now has optional `--generate-unique-url-keys` parameter which defaults to `false` to enable/disable the url key generation with name and id for categories - @rain2o (#232)
- `extensions/elastic-stock` module added which is a drop-in replacement for `stock`; the difference is that it's getting the stock information from Elastic, not from e-Commerce backend directly; to use it - please just make sure your `config/local.json` file has `elastic-stock` in the `registeredExtensions` collection; then please make sure in the `vue-storefront` to change the `config.stock.ednpoint`  from `http://<your-api-host>/api/stock` to `http://<your-api-host>/api/ext/elastic-stock`
- Added eslint config from vue-storefront so we have the same config and in both repos typescript support - @resubaka (#320)
- Added jest support - @resubaka (#321)
- Added caching factory and action factory for the image endpoint. This gives the possibility to use other services for caching or image processing - @resubaka (#317, #315)
- Added support for tax calculation where the values from customer_tax_class_ids is used - @resubaka (#307)
- The `db` context object - passed to every api endpoint now has two usefull methods: `getElasticClient` and `getRedisClient` for accesing the data stores - @pkarw (#328)
- The `lib/utils` got two new methods `getStoreCode(req: Express.Request)` and `getStoreView(code: string)` for getting the current multistore context from `vue-storefront` frontend requests - @pkarw

### Removed
- The `scripts/seo.js` tool has been removed, the legacy `migrations` scripts have been removed, the unused legacy extensions (`gls-parcelshop-dk`, `postnord-parcelshop-dk`) - @pkarw (#342)

### Fixed
- The way Elastic and Redis clients have been fixed and code duplication removed across the app - @pkarw (#327)
- The `product.price_*` fields have been normalized with the backward compatibility support (see `config.tax.deprecatedPriceFieldsSupport` which is by default true) - @pkarw (#289)
- The `product.final_price` field is now being taken into product price calcualtion. Moreover, we've added the `config.tax.finalPriceIncludesTax` - which is set to `true` by default. All the `price`, `original_price` and `special_price` fields are calculated accordingly. It was required as Magento2 uses `final_price` to set the catalog pricing rules after-prices - @pkarw (#289)

- Better handling of HTTP error codes provided by API client - #3151
